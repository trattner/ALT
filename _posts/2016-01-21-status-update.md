title: How does this thing work?

We've been getting lots of questions about how our service works.

The basic idea is to ensure that everyone has someone to lean on. We want to give you "pocket friends" so you can have a real conversation about whatever you want, whenever you want. Because we feel good when we text our friends and share what's on our mind, we hope this service will help you too: living happier is living healthier.

*So how does the peer support network actually work?*

![How It Works](/img/lean0nme_mit_cov.png "how it works: reasons we are not artists")


You send a text to our number in the cloud. This number automatically forwards your text to a bunch of Peer Supporters who have [signed up](http://lean0n.me/#supporters) in advance to respond. Being descriptive will help us match you better; once one of them responds, the two of you are engaged in a private text conversation.

Want to switch Peer Supporters or end the conversation? Just let your Peer Supporter know, or send "\switch" or "\end" to do it yourself. See a full list of commands [here](http://lean0n.me/#faq).

*The beauty of our system is its flexibility and unprecedented ease of connection. We offer a one on one interaction with a peer who genuinely wants to talk with you and has been through similar experiences. No apps, no downloads, no websites, no logins, no walking. And no Peer Supporter you text will ever see your phone number. It's totally anonymous.*

In order to have such a sweet deal, we make some tradeoffs. Your anonymity means that if you or friends are dealing with an emergency, we can't do anything and you should be looking for help [elsewhere](http://lean0n.me/resources/#existing-support). Since our Peer Supporters are volunteers, they can't provide counseling or suicide intervention. We are happy to listen and talk with you as friends, but please get the help you need from professionals.

[Our values](http://lean0n.me/resources/#policies) include relying a lot on trust. We trust our users and Peer Supporters to make safe, polite, and thoughtful decisions to use the service as it was created to be used: for genuine conversations with peers. It is hard for us to screen phone numbers so MIT students can only talk with MIT students; we trust our users to keep trolling and spamming to the millions of other, better, more visible places for those activities around the world wide web.

*Who made this and how is it funded?*

Linda, Nikhil, and Andy were united by a common set of beliefs, and we were passionate about giving students easily-accessible conversation, happiness, and support. We created our first prototype at HackMIT in September of 2015, where we won $1000. With personal funds and a TBP Fellowship, we are using our total $3500 to develop the system and keep our servers running. We operate independently of any existing organization, and we are not endorsed or supported by MIT, but we seek collaboration and feedback from everyone to help us build a happier, healthier environment of open conversation together.

*What should I do next?*

We have all experienced the power of a negative word bringing darkness to a day, but we also know the power of a positive word to brighten and even change a life. [Connect with us](http://lean0n.me/#contact) if you want to help out, [become a Peer Supporter](http://lean0n.me/#supporters), or [try texting](http://lean0n.me) and let's have a conversation!
